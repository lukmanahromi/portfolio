        <p>Hola! my name is <strong class="bold">Lukman Ahromi</strong>, usually called by <strong class="bold">Lukman</strong>, <strong class="bold">Luk</strong> or <strong class="bold">Man</strong> but you can call me anything even my last name <strong class="bold">Ahromi</strong> the nickname I've always wanted because the name is mixing by my parents name <strong class="bold">Ahmad</strong> and <strong class="bold">Rochaemi</strong>, sounds cool right?</p>
        <!-- <p>I'm 25 year old, graduated as Bachelor of Computer Science (B.C.S) in 2019 from <a href="https://www.itenas.ac.id/" class="link"><strong>Institut Teknologi Nasional Bandung</strong></a> with a major in Informatics. During college I did an internship for 3 months as web developer at <a href="http://bappeda.jabarprov.go.id/" class="link"><strong>Bappeda Provinsi Jawa Barat</strong></a>.</p> -->
        <p>In my spare time I'd like to listening some music on <strong class="bold">Spotify</strong>, watching series like <strong class="bold">Game Of Thrones</strong> or some K-Drama like <strong class="bold">Start Up</strong>. In 2002 or 2003, I start loving <strong class="bold">Chelsea F.C</strong>, at that time until now I've always watch their games every week. Getting emotional every win or losses filling my emptiness of life. There is one unpopular quotes when Chelsea win The Champion League in 2021 <strong style="font-style : italic;" class="bold">"When they called us the underdogs, we played like Champions"</strong>. Hopefully I can be like that, when everyone underestimated me, slowly learning everything to show them I can be <strong class="bold">the best</strong> in me in the future.</p>
